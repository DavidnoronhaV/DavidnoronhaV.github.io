They Said It Was Like A Real Train And You Could Put People And Goods In It And Make It Ride Along The Tracks.
But He Knew It Was Too Much To Ask For.</p>

Little Grace Sanders Knew About The Browns In Her Neighbourhood But She Never Cared To Do Anything For Them.
One Day She Saw Old Mrs.Brown And Asked Her "How Is Christmas For You?" And She Replied:
"No Very Good As You See We Can Barely Make Ends Meet And We Fell Sad That For Christmas We Can't Get Any Gifts For Our Little Ones.
So Christmas For Us Is A Very Sad Time.
The Jhonson's Would Help Cheer It Up A Bit But Their On Vacation Now."
